Flare is a location-based disaster precaution and response resource to assist users and Emergency Response Teams during natural disasters and emergencies. When severe weather advisories are released, the application will preemptively alert users of the potential disaster and offer suggested response protocol. In the event of a natural disaster, app holders can access a disaster manual with instructions for response to specific situations. Users can also self-report situations and locations to local Emergency Response Teams. Flare can have the capability to run in the background to periodically ping the user's location, stored in the event of disasters to alert Emergency Response Teams.
